/**
 * Board seed tests.
 *
 * The failures here are the quiet kind. A placement that does not reach its node leaves a card at
 * the origin, which looks like a layout that ignored the data rather than a lookup that missed. A
 * placed type nobody listed is simply never queried, so a community's own model is absent from a
 * board with nothing to say it was skipped. And a `Placement` drawn as a node puts a dot on the
 * canvas for every card, which reads as duplicate content.
